# the-odin-landing-page
We were allowed, by The Odin Project, to customize our project, so I customised mine to my taste.
The landing page built is a travel page where people can book their vacations online, though,
there is no functionality added to it, because the purpose of this project was to work on my 
HTML and Css skills.
